### Spacing
These options control spacing between characters, words, lines and, paragraphs.  You can use them to fine-tune the text for individual TextMesh Pro GameObjects, without adjusting their [font assets](FontAssets.md).

To control spacing within a single TextMesh Pro GameObject, use [rich text tags](RichText.md).
