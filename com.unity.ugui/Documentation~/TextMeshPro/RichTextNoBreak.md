# No Break

Use the `<nobr>` tag to keep specific words together, and not be separated by word wrapping.

The closing `</nobr>` tag reverts to the default behavior of allowing words to break where the line wraps.

If you apply the `<nobr>` tag to a segment of text that is too big to fit on one line, the segment will break wherever the line wraps.

**Example:**

```
You don't want <nobr>I M P O R T A N T</nobr> things to be broken up.
```
