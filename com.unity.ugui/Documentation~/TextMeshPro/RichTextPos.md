# Horizontal Position

The `<pos>` tag gives you direct control over the horizontal caret position. This works best with horizontal alignment.

The `<pos>` tag's position in the line has no effect on the caret position.

This tag is best used with left alignment.

You can specify the horizontal position in pixels, font units, or percentages.

**Example:**

```
at <pos=75%>75%
at <pos=25%>25%
at <pos=50%>50%
at 0%
```
