# Unity UI (uGUI)

> **⚠️ Experimental Package Notice**  
> The **`uGUI 3.0.0‑exp.x`** series is in **maintenance‑only mode**: it will continue to compile with new Unity Editor versions, but **no additional features, fixes, or improvements are planned**. We **strongly discourage** starting new projects on this experimental branch.

## Recommended Version
It is strongly recommended to use uGUI 2.0.0 for all production projects. Note that uGUI 2.0.0 ships with the Unity Editor as a built‑in package.

## About the Experimental Branch
`uGUI 3.0.0‑exp.x` contains an internal mechanism that lets **UI Toolkit** and **TextMesh Pro** reuse the **same sprite and font assets**, lowering memory usage when these systems coexist in a project.  
No additional investment is planned, and we do **not** intend to merge it into the core `uGUI` package in the near future.


## Getting Started
The full Unity UI manual is available in the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UISystem.html).
